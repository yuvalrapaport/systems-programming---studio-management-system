# systems-programming---studio-management-system
C++ program that simulates a fitness studio management system.
The program will open the studio, assign customers to trainers, make a workout plan that consists of one or more workout options, calculate the trainer's salary and other features as described in the running example.
The program will get a config file as an input, including all required information about the fitness studio opening - the number of trainers, how many customers each trainer can handle, and details about the studio's possible workouts.
